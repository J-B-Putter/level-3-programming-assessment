Welcome to Sailing Adventure!

This is a game focused on exploration and collecting elements to achieve a goal. 
You are the captain of a ship and you're looking for a sunken treasure. Clues are scattered around the map. You need to find them all to reveal the location of the treasure. 

How to Play:
- To move around, use the arrow keys or click on the arrow-buttons.
- Move around the map and search for clues. A message will pop up in the box if you are on the location of a clue (keep your eyes open for it!). Once you moved over the clue it automatically collects it for you. 
- If you found all the clues for the X coordinate of the treasure, it will display as a line on the map. This is the same for the Y coordinate. 
- When both X and Y coordinates are found, you can go to the location where they intersect to collect the treasure!
